# HairClassification Project

## Overview
The HairClassification project focuses on classifying hair lengths into categories such as long and short. The project includes scripts for data processing, model definition, and methods specific to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, keras

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarmenTheodoraCraciun/HairClasification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HairClasification
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Scripts Description

### 1. `dataProcessing.py`
This script is responsible for data preprocessing, which includes:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation methods are used to manage any missing data in the dataset.
- **Categorical Data Handling**: Converts categorical features into numerical values through encoding techniques.
- **Data Splitting**: Divides the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

### 2. `model3.py`
This script defines the model architecture for hair classification, including:
- **EncoderCNN**: Extracts feature vectors from input images using CNN layers.
- **DecoderRNN**: Generates descriptions for images based on the extracted feature vectors from the EncoderCNN.

### 3. `cnn_methods.py`
This script contains specific methods for utilizing CNNs in the project, such as:
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses CNN to extract relevant features from input images.
- **Model Training**: Trains the CNN using the available training data to learn and classify hair lengths.

## Usage
To run the scripts, follow these steps:
1. Preprocess the data using `dataProcessing.py`:
   ```bash
   python dataProcessing.py
   ```
2. Train the model using `model3.py`:
   ```bash
   python model3.py
   ```
3. Use the methods in `cnn_methods.py` for further feature extraction and model training as needed:
   ```bash
   python cnn_methods.py
   ```
